# INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMMITS AND BRANCHES

## SCOPE
These rules apply to every change the AI makes in this repository.

## COMMITS
- All commits must be written in English.
- A commit must be created for each logical, self-contained change — not for every file edit.
- Commits should group only changes that are directly related. Otherwise, separate commits must be made. Apply the principle of atomic commits: instead of combining unrelated changes (such as updating a logo and fixing a bug) into a single confusing commit, separate each change into its own commit with a clear message (e.g., `fix: correct cart calculation` and `feat: update logo`).
- Commit title format:
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <short imperative description>
  ```
  - `type`: one of the types listed below (required).
  - `scope`: optional, identifies the affected area (e.g., `auth`, `cart`, `api`).
  - `description`: imperative, lowercase, no trailing period, at most 72 characters.
- An optional body explains **why** the change was made (not what). Wrap it at 72 characters.
- An optional footer references tasks/issues (e.g., `Refs #123`) and declares breaking changes.
- Write the commit title as if you were giving a command (imperative): `add`, `fix`, `remove` — not `added`, `fixes`, `removed`.
- Commit messages must begin by indicating the purpose of the commit, limited to the following types:
  - `fix:` corrects errors.
  - `feat:` adds a new feature.
  - `docs:` changes documentation.
  - `refactor:` restructures code without changing behavior.
  - `perf:` improves performance.
  - `test:` adds or changes tests.
  - `build:` changes the build system or dependencies.
  - `ci:` changes continuous integration and/or deployment configuration.
  - `style:` formatting only (whitespace, missing periods and commas, etc.); it must not change behavior.
  - `chore:` maintenance tasks that do not fit the other types.
- Never mix formatting (`style:`) with behavior changes in the same commit.
- Breaking changes must be marked with `!` after the type/scope and described in a footer:
  ```
  feat(api)!: remove legacy authentication endpoint

  BREAKING CHANGE: clients must migrate to /v2/auth.
  ```
- Never commit secrets, credentials, `.env` files, build artifacts, or generated files. Make sure they are covered by `.gitignore`.
- Run the project's linters/formatters before committing and use pre-commit hooks when available.

### INCOMPLETE COMMITS
- `wip:` commits are allowed only on a feature/task branch, never on the integration branch (`main`).
- WIP commits are a local record of attempts and must be cleaned up before merging.
- Cleanup is done with an interactive rebase: reword unclear messages, squash commits that belong to the same logical step, and drop debug/accidental commits.
- The history that reaches `main` must read as a clear sequence of steps — not as a raw trail of attempts.

## BRANCHES
- Create a new specific branch (feature/task branch) for each problem or feature instead of using a single shared development branch.
- Every new branch must originate from the up-to-date integration branch (`main`).
- Branch naming must be clear, indicate its purpose, and strictly use one of the following prefixes followed by a short kebab-case description (and the task ID, if applicable):
  - `feature/` new features or functionalities (e.g., `feature/login-page`).
  - `bugfix/` bugs found during development, testing, or code review (e.g., `bugfix/cart-error`).
  - `hotfix/` urgent bug fixes applied directly to production (e.g., `hotfix/payment-crash`).
  - `refactor/` restructuring, performance improvements, or technical debt cleanup that does not add features or fix bugs (e.g., `refactor/database-queries`).
  - `chore/` maintenance and tooling (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`).
  - `docs/` documentation-only changes (e.g., `docs/api-reference`).
  - `test/` test-only changes (e.g., `test/checkout-coverage`).
  - `ci/` CI/CD pipeline changes (e.g., `ci/add-lint-stage`).
- Branch name format: `<type>/<short-kebab-description>[-<TASK-ID>]`, at most 50 characters.
- Keep branches short-lived: break complex problems into smaller, incremental tasks to prevent massive merge conflicts.
- Delete the branch after it is merged.

## MERGE STRATEGY
- The integration branch is `main`.
- The default strategy is to merge the task branch preserving its individual commits, so the history shows the step-by-step evolution of the work.
- Never squash the entire branch into a single commit.
- Before merging, clean up the branch with an interactive rebase (see INCOMPLETE COMMITS).
- Merge only when CI is green (see INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_CI_CD.md) and the review is approved.
- Use a merge commit (`git merge --no-ff`, or the "Create a merge commit" option on the platform) so each commit is preserved and the branch is still visible as a group in the history.
- After merging, delete the branch and update the integration branch.

## STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW
```bash
# 1. Update the integration branch
git switch main
git pull --ff-only

# 2. Create the task branch
git switch -c feature/short-description

# 3. Commit each logical step as it is completed (`wip:` is allowed here)
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat(scope): describe the step"

# 4. Sync with main and resolve conflicts before review
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# 5. Clean the history: reword, squash same-step commits, drop debug commits
git rebase -i origin/main

# 6. Run tests and linters locally

# 7. Push the branch
git push -u origin feature/short-description
# after rebasing an existing remote branch:
git push --force-with-lease

# 8. Open the pull request and wait for review + green CI

# 9. Merge preserving the commits (merge commit)
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git merge --no-ff feature/short-description

# 10. Delete the branch and update main
git branch -d feature/short-description
git push origin --delete feature/short-description
git pull --ff-only
```
- Never use plain `git push --force`; always use `--force-with-lease`.
- Never rebase a shared branch or the integration branch.
- Verify the result with `git log --graph --oneline main`.

## PULL REQUESTS
- The PR title follows the commit convention.
- The description must contain:
  - **What** changed.
  - **Why** it changed.
  - **How** it was tested (commands and results).
- Link the task/issue.
- Do not open a PR with failing CI or unfinished WIP commits.
- Keep the PR focused; split unrelated changes into separate PRs.
